The most finished asset is going to be church_Greyscale_towerwork

The Vynil Despenser is the model that goes inside the pulpit to hold records

simplepulpit is the pulpit finished but seperated parts
	simplepulpitjoined is the pulpit with its parts combined
	Would recommend redoing the joining after texturing

The rest of the files are just other stages of the church that do not need
to be used

None of the models are textured yet
